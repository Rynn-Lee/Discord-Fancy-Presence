## ü§î What's this project?
This is an enthusiastic project that came up to my mind someday<br>
Have you tried to make your own rich-presence status for discord with NodeJS?<br>
It's inconvinient and not dynamic, right?<br>
This project exists to help you with your custom status<br>

## ‚ùî Why do i need a custom status for discord?
It's beautiful and customizable! It represents you!<br>
Your favorite app doesn't have an rpc? You want to show off or prank people?<br>
With this app you can choose what to show in your status when a selected app is running<br>
It also has a built in preview of your rpc!<br>
You have an ability to set a custom ClientID, so it will show any app's name you want (Fancy-DRPC by default)

## üíª What tech stack is used?
Front-end: NextJS, Sass, styled-components<br>
Back-end: Tauri, Rust<br>
State management: context-api <br>
